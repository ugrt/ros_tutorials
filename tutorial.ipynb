    "# ROS (more specifically ROS2)\n",
    "In software, it is good practice to modularize your code into separate functions, and call those functions in order to preform that given task. What if you wanted to use multiple lanuages or have the benifits of one given lanuage like python, with the speed of C or C++. Then you would be best writing python wrappers for all of your code and calling those wrappers within python. However that is not always possible due to the time that python takes between each step. Back in 2007, when researchers were making a new research robot, they decided that making an operating system to emphisie code modularity and useablity was born as ROS. ROS2 was born 11 years latter as major breaking changes needed to be made to make it better suited for commercial applications. but enough into the history. Lets give it a try\n"

    "I mentioned topics briefly above how it is one of the ways that you can talk across multiple nodes, and across different machines. Once you see across machines and across multiple programming languages, standard network communication is the way that ROS does this, where each topic is a port on a given machine. If the work port went over your head, that is fine as that is ROS doing its job. For this to work though, there needs to be some structure shared between the nodes. This is called a message, and there are part of the libraries that are used to rebuild that data at each node. You can see all of the interfaces that are installed by running the following command\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ros2 interface list\n",
    "```\n",
    "This should list all interfaces that are installed on that system. To focus on more of the details, we are going to take a look at the /cmd_vel topic, and its message interface in a bit more detail. Running the following command gets us the following output\n",

    "Subscription count: 1\n",

For the most part you can set these to be 10, and it should operate smoothly.\n",

    "    self.cmd_vel_pub.publish(self.cmd_vel_out)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this Node, this function will be called about every (1/30)s, will get the current values of linear velocity and angular velocity and publish it to cmd_vel. One thing to keep in mind is to make sure that you always exit your function, as it will then make time for other functions to execute.\n",

    "One thing to note is that all functions are assumed to be blocking (e.g another function will not run in the same node), when called, like a single threaded microcontroller. This is due to variole safety. If you are interested more in this problem check out operating systems.\n",

    "1. handle and process that data right away, and resend it\n",
    "1. store the data in a shared variable, and process it in a timer or another function callback\n",
    "  - You will see this in nodes that take multiple points of data, and handle that data in some form (Ex. P2P navigation)\n",
